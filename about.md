I am an IT Architect and Developer from Munich. I am interested in everything InsuranceTech especially healthcare related.

Currently working on building an ecosystem to connect customer bases, externalizing functional capabilities as an API (e.g. a well-trained mood and intent detection algorithm for customer mails in the insurance domain) to create better offerings in the insurance space together.
