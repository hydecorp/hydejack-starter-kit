The economies of scale ([why will software eat the world](#) forces enterpise to become global. Most enterprise
established a regional differentiated network of local organizational units. Ask services will become more global
those OEs will need to be integrated again. 

An Example that empasise this trend is WhatsApp that served a global market from one country with a small team.

The key to integrated your OEs back into on digital unit are APIs: 
* first on global API language so that the interface is the same
* next get one interface for the complete company 
    * establish on global authentication endpoint for all 
    * based on the result (which includes from which region the customer comes) the request is publish either with a message or per direct request to the backend and is serve
* The backends and services get integrated to one offering in all regions (which should be the best of all world - security and coverage from germany, customer service from the US , ... all over the world)


## Open Questions:
* Language? How does Google do it?
* Legal?
