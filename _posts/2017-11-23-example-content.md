# Posts need to have the `post` layout
layout: post

# The title of your post
title: Example Content

# (Optional) Write a short (~150 characters) description of each blog post.
# This description is used to preview the page on search engines, social media, etc.
description: >
  A page showing how regular markdown content is styled in Hydejack.

# (Optional) Link to an image that represents your blog post.
# The aspect ratio should be ~16:9.
image: /assets/img/default.jpg

# You can hide the description and/or image from the output
# (only visible to search engines) by setting:
hide_description: true
hide_image: true

# (Optional) Each post can have zero or more categories, and zero or more tags.
# The difference is that categories will be part of the URL, while tags will not.
# E.g. the URL of this post is <site.baseurl>/hydejack/2017/11/23/example-content/
categories: [hydejack]
tags: [example, content]
# If you want a category or tag to have its own page,
# check out `_featured_categories` and `_featured_tags` respectively.

## Hydejack Exclusives
Hydejack offers a few additional features to markup your markdown.
Don't worry, these are merely CSS classes added with kramdown's `{:.my-class}` syntax,
so that your posts remain compatible with other Jekyll themes.

You can add a message box by adding the `message` class to a paragraph.
{:.message}

You can add gray text by adding the `faded` class.
{:.faded}

You can add large text by adding the `lead` class to a paragraph.
{:.lead}

> You can make a quote "pop out" by adding the `lead` class to a quote.
{:.lead}

You can make an image span the full width by adding the `lead` class:

![Full-width image](https://placehold.it/800x100){:.lead}

Inline math $$ f(x) = x^2 $$ and math blocks:

            &= \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n x_i y_j \phi(e_i, e_j)            \\[2em]
            &= (x_1, \ldots, x_n)
