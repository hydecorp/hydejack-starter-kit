**TL;DR:** I experiement with setting up my blog on github pages because of simplicity and code is a first class citizen.

## Why use github pages for your blog? 

It is simple, it is markdown, it is versioned and it has first class support for code which is great if you use it as a knowledge base for things you do. 

## How to set it up 

Just follow the instructions at https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now#quick-start. 

Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/config.png)

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
